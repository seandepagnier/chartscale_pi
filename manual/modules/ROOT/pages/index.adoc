This document is about ChartScale-plugin (Chartscale-pi)

== 1. What and Why
 
The plugin allows the user to zoom in and out by means of a slider.

Normally use the (+) and (-) buttons or the mouse scroll-wheel for zooming in and out, but maybe you prefer to use a slider. The position of the slider (far left, far right or somewhere in between) gives you a direct indication of the zoom-status. +

== 2. Installation

Install and Enable the plugin: xref:opencpn-plugins:misc:plugin-install.adoc[Instructions] +

Once the plugin is installed and enabled  Click “*OK*” in the Chart Scale Preferences window and then “*OK*” in the Plugins-window. +

Now the Chart Scale slider should appear on your screen.

In this example the slider-button is to the far left. That means “zoom in as far as possible”.

And in this example the slider-button is to the far right. That means “zoom out as far as possible”.
